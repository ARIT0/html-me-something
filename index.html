                    <h2>Vitamin A</h2>
                    <p id="info">
                        Vitamin A is key for good vision, a healthy immune system, and cell growth. 
                        It is a collective term for a number of molecules that include retinoids 
                        <i>retinol</i> (the transport form of vitamin A),
                        <i>retinal</i> (also known as <i>retinaldehyde</i>, used as a photopigment 
                        in the retina), and <i>retinoic acid</i>. The active form of vitamin 
                        A--retinoids--come from animal products. Beta-carotene
                        is among the second type of vitamin A, which comes from plants. Most of these
                         molecules are ultimately derived from dietary beta-carotene, present in such 
                        foods as carrots, leafy vegetables, and egg yolk.

                    <h2>Vitamin B Complex</h2>
                    <p id="info">
                        Vitamin B complex is composed of eight B vitamins:
                        B1 (thiamine): Thiamine plays an essential role in metabolism by helping convert nutrients into energy. The richest food sources include pork, sunflower seeds and wheat germ.
                        B2 (riboflavin): Riboflavin helps convert food into energy and also acts as an antioxidant. Foods highest in riboflavin include organ meats, beef and mushrooms.
                        B3 (niacin): Niacin plays a role in cellular signaling, metabolism and DNA production and repair. Food sources include chicken, tuna and lentils.
                        B5 (pantothenic acid): Like other B vitamins, pantothenic acid helps your body obtain energy from food and is also involved in hormone and cholesterol production. Liver, fish, yogurt and avocado are all good sources.
                        B6 (pyridoxine): Pyridoxine is involved in amino acid metabolism, red blood cell production and the creation of neurotransmitters. Foods highest in this vitamin include chickpeas, salmon and potatoes.
                        B7 (biotin): Biotin is essential for carbohydrate and fat metabolism and regulates gene expression. Yeast, eggs, salmon, cheese and liver are among the best food sources of biotin.
                        B9 (folate): Folate is needed for cell growth, amino acid metabolism, the formation of red and white blood cells and proper cell division. It can be found in foods like leafy greens, liver and beans or in supplements as folic acid.
                        B12 (cobalamin): Perhaps the most well-known of all the B vitamins, B12 is vital for neurological function, DNA production and red blood cell development. B12 is found naturally in animal sources like meats, eggs, seafood and dairy.
                        
                        The major vitamins from the B complex are B1 (thiamine), B2 (riboflavin), B6 (pyridoxine), and B12 (cobalamin) which can all be found in liver.

                        Vitamin C is necessary for the growth, development and repair of all body tissues.
                            It's involved in many body functions, including formation of collagen, absorption of iron,
                            the immune system, wound healing, and the maintenance of cartilage, bones, and teeth.
                            Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin function as antioxidants through their ability to inactivate free radicals.
                            It may afford protection against some of the diseases that may be caused by free radicals. Good sources of

                    <h2>Vitamin D</h2>
                    <p id="info">
                        Vitamin D is produced by the skin under the influence of ultraviolet light, but usually it is not produced in sufficient 
                        amounts for all of the body's needs. Vitamin D is needed for intestinal absorbtion of calcium and phosphate. Vitamin D has
                         other roles in the body, including modulation of cell growth, neuromuscular and immune function, and reduction of inflammation. 
                         Even though it can be produced by the body it is important to eat food containing additional amounts of vitamin D if you are not 
                         exposed to the sun. Can be found in fish liver.

                    <h2>Vitamin E</h2>
                    <p id="info">
                        Vitamin E has important antioxidant functions. Antioxidants protect cells from
                        the damaging effects of free radicals, which are molecules that contain an 
                        unshared electron. Free radicals damage cells and might contribute to the 
                        development of cardiovascular disease and cancer .Vitamin E is rare and 
                        usually due to an underlying problem with digesting dietary fat rather 
                        than from a diet low in vitamin E and can cause nerve problems. Can be found
                        in milk, eggs, meat, and leafy vegetables.
